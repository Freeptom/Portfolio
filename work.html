        This is a website currently in development, built by myself and a friend for a climbing instructor.
        <br>
        <br> This website was also created as a surprise. Putting newly aquired skills into practice, from an Agile meetup, we
        delivered a MVP. We purposefully didn't put too much time into the design. We took this approach as we knew the potential
        for the design to develop, in line with the needs of our 'client'.
        <br>
        <br> After showing our client what we had so far, he supplied lots of feedback which we are now in the process of implementing.

        <p class="post-content">
          A website I created as a surprise for my girlfriend, Bekah, to celebrate the adventures we'd been on. It was my re-entry
          into coding after universty.
          <br>
          <br> I used the W3.CSS framework as it was lightweight.
          <br>
          <br> While it was effective in getting the website built quickly, it made me realise I wanted to re-learn HTML, CSS and
          Javascript by hand-coding websites.

      <h2>Jeffrey Zeldman: 20 Years of Web Design and Community</h2>
      <div class="content read-more">
        <p class="quote">
          If you haven't listened to Jeffrey Zeldman's insightful podcast,
          '<a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow">The Big Webshow</a>', I wholeheartedly recommend it - it's super binge worthy.
          </p>
    
        <p class="post-content">
          I've learnt a lot while listening to the wide array of experts Jeffrey has interviewed and I'm sure you will too. Episode #176 is particularly awesome, featuring the amazing Jen Simmons, creator of
          '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/layoutland">Layout Land</a>' and member of the CSS Working Group.
          <br><br>
          You can hear the passion she has for the web in her explaination of the new, exciting tools we now have. The web can look amazing, without exploiting those hacky workarounds it was originally built on.
          <br><br>
          Anyway, back to Jeffrey. He's a huge proponent for web standards and was one of the first to bring the idea to the forefront of developers' minds. In doing so, he transformed how we create for the web, and did so pretty much overnight. The battle of the browsers ceased and allowed our web to become what it is today.
          <br><br>
          This documentary looks at Jeffrey's work in shaping the web. If you're interested in learning about web standards and how they were formed, it's worth a watch. I really liked what he said about sharing, it's what the web is all about, so I thought I'd share it here.

      <h2> Agile Yorkshire Meetup</h2>
      <div class="content read-more">
        <p class="quote">
          Yesterday evening, I visited Platform, nearby Leeds Train Station to attend the Agile Yorkshire meetup.
          <br><br>
          I learnt and practiced the Agile approach at uni, implementing it into a team based Ecommerce project. My favourite aspect was the way sprints worked. The approach enabled me to work dynamically, responding to developments in my knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="post-content">
          The first talk, 'How Our PO Learned to Stop Worrying and Love MVP' was presented by Joe Williams, a developer at Sky who worked on the Sky Sports Live Player App.
          <br><br>
          Joe's team was tasked with delivering a new version of the Live Player app, to meet the deadline of the start of the Premier League, just a few weeks away at the time.
          <br><br>
          The team's PO (Product Owner), having seen similar apps to Sky's, wanted all the bells and whistles imaginable. The team however, knew they wouldn't be able to deliver such a thing, being only a few short weeks away from the Premier League... This made the PO stressed... Which, in turn, the team mirrored.
          <br><br>
          The solution? Minimal Viable Product (MVP). This goes hand in hand with the Agile process - it's all about iteration. The first release didn't have to be perfect, so long as it delivered enough and hit the primary functions. It's a given that the product will be worked on, so why not release it, then gain user feedback which can then steer further iterations? 
          <br><br>
          Joe and his team pushed for this approach and thankfully the PO was satisfied. Something workable would be delivered, not some half baked, bug-ridden app that risked the reputation of the company.
          <br><br>
          The approach worked and the app was a success, increasing viewership of the matches greatly. Joe and his team improved the app with every sprint. Match updates were instantaneous on the next release when they were originally a few minutes behind.
          <br><br>
          All-in-all, MVP looks to be a worthy approach, especially when deadlines are tight and deliverables need to function.

          Hello, World! I'm Tom, a web designer and developer who's on the hunt for that golden opportunity to showcase my talent and further develop my skills. It's really exciting to finally get this site live and out for eyes to see.
          <br><br>
          So what's this blog all about then?

          <p class="post-content">
           I'll be using it to share my web development journey with the aim to help others. I imagine the ‘Others’ to be, like me, curious, confused and endlessly excited to create for the web. Hopefully I can share a few cool tricks along the way!
